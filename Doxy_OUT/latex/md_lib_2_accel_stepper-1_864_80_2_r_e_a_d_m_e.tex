This fork follows the {\texttt{ upstream version}}. Files are slightly reorganized to follow Arduino library conventions to allow for inclusion into the Arduino IDE library manager.

This is the Arduino \doxyref{Accel\+Stepper}{p.}{class_accel_stepper} library. It provides an object-\/oriented interface for 2, 3 or 4 pin stepper motors and motor drivers.

The standard Arduino IDE includes the Stepper library ({\texttt{ http\+://arduino.\+cc/en/\+Reference/\+Stepper}}) for stepper motors. It is perfectly adequate for simple, single motor applications.

\doxyref{Accel\+Stepper}{p.}{class_accel_stepper} significantly improves on the standard Arduino Stepper library in several ways\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Supports acceleration and deceleration
\item Supports multiple simultaneous steppers, with independent concurrent stepping on each stepper
\item API functions never delay() or block
\item Supports 2, 3 and 4 wire steppers, plus 3 and 4 wire half steppers.
\item Supports alternate stepping functions to enable support of AFMotor ({\texttt{ https\+://github.\+com/adafruit/\+Adafruit-\/\+Motor-\/\+Shield-\/library}})
\item Supports stepper drivers such as the Sparkfun Easy\+Driver (based on 3967 driver chip)
\item Very slow speeds are supported
\item Extensive API
\item Subclass support
