This project handles user interface interactions using a rotary encoder and buttons, allowing for navigation through menus, adjustment of settings, and controlling a display. It implements a multitasking approach using Free\+RTOS to manage various tasks concurrently.\hypertarget{index_dependencies}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{dependencies}{dependencies}}\label{index_dependencies}

This file includes the global configurations and necessary libraries for the project. The setup function initializes all configurations, including RTOS (Real-\/\+Time Operating System) tasks, which manage the entire functionality of the system.

The main loop ({\ttfamily void \doxylink{main_8cpp_afe461d27b9c48d5921c00d521181f12f}{loop()}}) is intentionally left empty, as the RTOS tasks are responsible for the continuous execution of system tasks, following a multi-\/threading approach. The tasks are created and managed in the setup function.
